Revenue Budget Form
	%baseurl%/revBudget
Expenditure Budget Form
	%baseurl%/expBudget/
	[Suggested titles: Revenue/Expense Budget]
	To be used by Accountants only.
	These are forms where the user can enter the budgeted amounts for the current term. There is initially a dropdown box where the user selects a term [is it a term or a fiscal year?]. Once the term is selected and a 'Next' button clicked, the dropdown box is replaced by the budget entry form:
	The form is a table with four columns: Fund, Category, Ledger Account and Budget. The Category and Ledger Account columns will be populated with values from the database and not user-editable. Cells in the Fund column will be dropdown boxes, and cells in the budget column will be numeric. All cells will be populated with previously saved values, if any.
	Additionally, on the expense budget form, since there are many more expense ledger accounts, the table will have header rows for each category. The table will initially be collapsed so that the user sees only the totals for each category. The user can click on a header row to expand and view/edit all of the individual ledger account values for that category.
	There is a 'Submit' button at the bottom of the form, which saves the values to the database. There is a 'Back' button, which allows the user to go back and select a different term [year?].
